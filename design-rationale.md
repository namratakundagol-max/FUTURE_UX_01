# Design Rationale — Local Services Website

This website redesign focuses on conversion, lead generation, and clear user experience for a local home cleaning service business.

## 1. Hero Section with Clear CTA
The homepage starts with a strong value proposition and a “Book Now” button. This immediately tells users what the service is and encourages action.

## 2. Services Displayed Early
Service cards are shown right after the hero section so users quickly understand what services are offered without scrolling too much.

## 3. Use of Icons and Cards
Icons and card layout improve visual clarity, making the website easy to scan and more engaging.

## 4. Simple Lead Capture Form
The contact page contains a very simple form (name, phone, service) to reduce friction and increase chances of user submission.

## 5. Clean Layout and Spacing
Proper spacing, modern font (Poppins), and color theme improve readability and professional appearance.

## 6. Mobile Friendly Structure
The layout uses flexible cards and spacing so it works well on mobile devices.

## 7. Trust and Professional Look
Consistent colors, shadows, and alignment build trust and make the website look reliable.
